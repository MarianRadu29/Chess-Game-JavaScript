# Chess-Game-JavaScript
I have created a chess game between 2 users (no computer player) in
which the classic rules of chess are applied. The chessboard can be rotated
automatically or manually (using the rotate button), the choice is made by
the users.
Rules implemented:\n
  -Move different types of pieces;\n
  -King Chess Rules;\n
  -Chess King machine rules;\n
  -Rocada (small and large);\n
  -Promotion of the pawn;\n
  etc.\n
The game might have small bugs.
